When the three Traveling Immortals came up to Blackheaven Sect, Yi Qing was a mere Nascent Soul. He wouldn't have had the chance to go if the people from their sect had not been so useless. To think that the three of them had fought so hard to come home with so many spirit herbs in tow and had even given everything they had found to the sect. Now, in the face of trouble, these people were willing to give up Yi Qing's life to save their own?</seg>

He pointed at a few spots on the map.

However, after the invasion by the Demonic beast, many of the immortals left the city. Logically speaking, this city is built on top of the immortal pulse, so for the places that do not have immortals to breathe in the immortal Qi, there should be a lot of immortal Qi there.

He was sensible and did not probe any further, only talking about his personal accounts. "My name is Chen Ge and I was stabbed in the back tens of thousands of years ago. It was the that the Demon Seed was planted within me.  I was in grave danger and badly hurt at that time, hence my only choice was to seal it within me for the time being. Who knew, that the Devil Seed would've grown stronger with the passing of each day and eventually merge with the Demon within me. By the time I recovered and found out about it, it was too late. If I were to exorcise it out of me by force, it would do harm to my Cultivation and I could potentially even be banished into another big spiritual realm." </seg>

The techniques related to spirit beasts required one to first get familiar with a spirit beast which required a long time. Sometimes, in order to earn the spirit beast's trust, one had to live with it. That explained why few female cultivators enjoyed taming beasts, especially when it came to high-level spirit beasts which looked as terrifying as Xue Yin did. Yi Feng was happy to know that Shen Ying was interested—she was a rare find indeed. "Spirit beasts may look scary, but as you interact with them, you'll find that they're actually more sentimental than humans are. Xue Yin is like that. Once it acknowledges its master, it will follow its master for life. Humans just tend to be superficial. They get scared once they see how scary these beasts look."</seg>

Although he committed many acts of evil, he managed to keep his whereabouts a secret. No one knew where his old hideout, the Myriad Fiend Den was. Also, he had perfected his Golden Core cultivation and possessed the Soul Devouring Gonfalon. There was no real chance of defeating him even with the help of a Nascent Soul cultivator. Many times the Blackheaven Sect had wanted to besiege his hideout but could not find any trace of him. And to think that Yi Qing had managed to solve this problem. He had actually defeated the Soul Devouring Gonfalon, whose cultivation level was higher than his. He definitely lived up to the high standards expected of a sword cultivator.

Even though he continued to persevere and cultivate throughout the six years of the Grand Elder’s disappearance and had painstakingly boosted his cultivation from nothing up to the first stage of the Cast Tripod Realm, his position in the family continued to deteriorate.

Two years ago he was forced to move out from the Jiang Residence’s rear court into the servants’ complex situated in the west court. Just a few days ago, he was also made to take up the responsibility of handling the family's herb plantations half a year earlier than normal. This was a job that sixteen-year-old descendants who were deemed useless for not being able to cultivate to the third stage of the Cast Tripod Realm would usually take on.</seg>

        <seg>In the meantime, Jiang Yunshan privately instructed his men to buy in as much rare treasures and artifacts as possible, in preparation of bribing the Western Garrison Army officers when they came to Skyplume City. He had hoped that with the bribery, more descendants of the Jiang Clan would be allowed enrollment in the army. Indeed, of all the families, the Jiang Clan was most entitled to pull strings with the Western Garrison Army officers, because the commander of the Western Garrison Army, the Western Garrison Liege Lord, also held the surname of 'Jiang'. By this logic, the Jiang Clan was, in very loose terms, a side branch of the liege lord's family clan. In addition, in the early years of his life, Grand Elder Jiang Yunhai used to work in the household of the Western Garrison Liege Lord as a servant, which served as another layer of association. </seg>

        <seg>Lonemoon did not carry much hope for these disciples in the beginning; after all, the reason that there were very few Sword Cultivators was because the requirements for people to learn in this way of cultivation was extremely high.

In Yi Qing’s case, he was born with an Innate Sword Embodiment, but it was very rare to come by those who could even achieve the Nascent Soul stage as a Sword Cultivator as seen in the entire Middle Azure World in which there was only one Soul Formation Sword Cultivator. And this went true even for the Upper Azure World where talents were abundant. It needn’t be said that the path of a Sword Cultivator was extremely difficult.</seg>
